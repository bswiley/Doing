# Im-feeling-quizzy

## Description


I got the questions and answers from https://www.sanfoundry.com/1000-javascript-questions-answers/ and https://www.interviewbit.com/javascript-mcq/

## Installation
I have already deployed this to the website https://bswiley.github.io/What-to-do/ so nothing further needs to be done to get it to work.  A copy of the index is at the same level in the repository as is this README.md file.  Also in the same directory is a ![screencapture](screencapture.png) of the finished webpage.
